## Exasol Styles

Exasol's official style guide is the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style). Reference all questions there first. If the Google Style Guide does not answer your question, as the Google Style Guide recommends, go to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

Some Exasol styles do differ from Google and Microsoft, and Exasol is in the process of changing styles to more align with Google. Please scan the following style guide for information on Exasol specific styles.

# Issue Processing Timeline

When you notify us of an incident or an error in the software, we will confirm the receipt within the agreed reaction times and will request additional information if required. Exasol does not send you automated replies; even if you get a standard reply, it means that a support agent has read and understood your inquiry and has started working on the ticket. 

The following picture describes this timeline:

If the problem is verifiable, Exasol will inform you within the processing time whether the problem is a Software Error and will provide an assessment as to when a solution will be available or when the error will be fixed. If the problem is not verifiable, Exasol will inform you regularly within the processing times about the status and next steps of the Root Cause Identification. This may include requests for additional information or to conduct tests in the affected environment.
